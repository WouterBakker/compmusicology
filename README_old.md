During this week, I have discovered some methods to extend the music analysis beyond just Spotify. This has also led me to change my corpus. Since 2014, I have been keeping track of nearly every song I have listened to. I did this using a website called LastFM. Music I have listened to using desktop programs like iTunes and MusicBee are included. Spotify has a function built in that allows all the music that is played to be synched to LastFM as well. Recording a play is called scrobbling, and this way I have “scrobbled” more than 118.000 played songs since around April 2014, nearly 6 years. Using a package called “scrobbler” I have imported all my scrobbles to R, and saved it as a .csv file.
